# MovieSearchChallenge
Robot for Movie Search Challenge from rpachallenge.com

The robot will:
Get 3 popular movies from rpachallenge.com
Get text from each review from the three movies
Analize texts on a text sentiment analize
Says if the review is positive or negative
Submit result to challenge

That is the first version of the robot, it still rough but the main objective is working fine
Soon I'll do some implementations.
